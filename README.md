# Linux Teams
Linux Teams is an unofficial Microsoft Teams application for Linux.

## Why?
At the date of the creation of this project, Microsoft didn't provide a Linux application for Teams. Besides that, the notification on the Web Application is very limited.

This project aims to solve both of this problems wrapping the Web Application on a native application using Electron and implementing some fixes to provide better notifications.

## Installing
This project is at early stage, so I'm not providing any installer until there's something useful. Until then, you may [run this application from source](#running-from-source).

### Running from source
You will need Git and npm to run this application.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/arslivinski/linux-teams.git
$ cd linux-teams
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

As the focus here is to create a Linux application, I'm not testing against other operational systems like Windows or macOS. However, should be no problem to run this application on these OS.
